# Deployment Timestamp Visualizer

Media timeline explorer built with `polars`, `charton`, and `wasm-bindgen`.

## Overview
This project ships as a local WASM web app by default. Running the binary starts a local server and opens an interactive browser interface for exploring media timestamp distributions by deployment.  

It is part of the [Serval](https://github.com/wsyxbcl/Serval) workflow where users review timestamps and deployments.
